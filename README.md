# React Employee Directory Application
  

# Employee Directory Guidelines

This is a a React application deployed via Github that allows the user to sort and filter a list of employees - specifically by age and gender. The client requires that an employee or manager would be able to view non-sensitive data about other employees and sort and filter by desired criteria. The application will be invoked with the following command:



### npm start



The specific features of the application are outlined in the acceptance criteria provided by the client. 

# Acceptance Criteria Requirements:

* The user should be able to <b>Sort</> the table by at least one category
